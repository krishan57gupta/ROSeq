Description: ROSeq - A rank based approach to modeling gene expression with filtered and
    normalized read count matrix. ROSeq takes filtered and normalized read matrix 
    and cell-annotation/condition as input and determines the differentially
    expressed genes between the contrasting groups of single cells. One of the 
    input parameters is the number of cores to be used.
